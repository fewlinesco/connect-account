# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any unnecessary files (e.g. generated assets / build files /
   dependencies / ) are removed before the pull request. Also, make sure you
   don't commit your own personal files (e.g. .idea, .vscode, .swp,...).

   If the files are related to the project, add them to project's .gitignore
   file; if they are your own personal files (e.g. editor configuration), add
   them to your own global ~/.gitignore file.
2. Update the README.md if appropriate with details of changes to the interface,
   this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations
   and container parameters.
3. Look at the [CodeCov][CODECOV] report and make sure the code coverage doesn't
   go down.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of your current
   pair, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the
   reviewer to merge it for you.
5. Follow the rules described in the [Guideline][GUIDELINES] repository about
   standard conventions and specific one for your language if it applies.
