## Setup

Before being able to start the project locally, you should have a way to run `Node.js` applications.

We recommend you to install the latest version of `asdf` to do so.

You will need `nodejs` and `yarn`.
These can be installed via the provided `.tool-versions` using `asdf install`.


Get required environment variables by copying `.env.sample` and if necessary tuning it to values relevant to your dev environment:

[source,shell]
----
cp .env_vars.sample .env_vars
----

Source the file to get variables defined your environnement:

[source,shell]
----
source .env_vars
----

== Development Process
