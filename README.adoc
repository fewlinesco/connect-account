= Connect.Account
:toc: preamble

Connect.Account is an open source web application, which aims at providing all the business logic to handle Connect identities, profile and addresses data, and a default frontend for users to use.

== Flows

=== Connect authentication flow

== NPM scripts

=== Setup

Before being able to start the project locally, you should have a way to run `Node.js` applications.

We recommend you to install the latest version of `asdf` to do so.

You will need `nodejs` and `yarn`.
These can be installed via the provided `.tool-versions` using `asdf install`.

Get required environment variables by copying `.env.sample` and if necessary tuning it to values relevant to your dev environment:

[source, shell]
----
cp .env_vars.sample .env_vars
ln -s Procfile.dev Procfile
----

Source the file to get variables defined your environnement:

[source, shell]
----
source .env_vars
----

The application also needs couple external tools to work properly:
- hivemind
- docker
- docker-compose
- nginx
- mkcert

To install them on MacOS, you can run the following:
[source, shell]
----
brew bundle install --file Brewfile
----

Then, install dependencies:
[source, shell]
----
yarn install
----

== HTTPS certificates

To allow TLS locally, we are using a `nginx` proxy. The proxy listens port 29704, and redirects — with the certificates — on port 29703.

You might need the HTTPS certificates on your localhost to allow cookies writing.

If you are using Firefox as your web browser, you'll need `nss` alongside `mkcert`.
----
brew install nss
----

To generate certificates:
----
mkdir certs
(cd certs; mkcert connect-account.local)
----

Then, add the local FQDN in `/etc/hosts`:
----
echo "127.0.0.1 connect-account.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "::1 connect-account.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
----

== Development Process

[source, shell]
----
hivemind # or overmind s

# In an other terminal tab
docker-compose up
----

Access your application on URL: `https://connect-account.local:29704`.

If you want to build and start the application, you should run the following:

[source, shell]
----
yarn build && yarn start [-p 29703]
----

=== Database

We made the choice to use https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/[DynamoDB].

The `users` DynamoDB table is created automatically during the docker compose launch.

If you want to interact with the database, you can use the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/dynamodb/[AWS CLI], of use one of the following npm scripts that use the SDK:


|===
| Name | Description

| `db:create-users-table`
| Create the `users` table.

| `db:reset-users-table`
| Reset the `users` table.

| `db:delete-users-table`
| Delete the `users` table.

| `db:put-user`
| Put a user entry in the `users` table.

| `db:get-user-from-sub sub`
| Get the user entry the `users` table using its `sub`.
|===

=== Testing

To run integration and unit tests :

[source, shell]
----
yarn test
----

To run the e2e tests suite on local environment :

[source, shell]
----
yarn test:e2e:local
----

=== Linting

We use a set of strict linting rules through `TypeScript` and `ESLint`. While `TypeScript` config is pretty standard, the `ESLint` one is mostly set with our own custom package, called https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fewlines/eslint-config[@fewlines/eslint-config]. You should read the documentation if you want the full power of the config while using `VSCode`.

> Note that, contrary to `errors`, `warnings` do not break testing or app compilation.

You can manually lint, using:

[source, shell]
----
yarn lint
----

or

[source, shell]
----
yarn lint --fix
----

if you want to automatically fix linting issues.

== TypeScript

=== Type declaration

The rule we follow is that, if a declared type is only used in one file, we locate it in said file. Otherwise, we move it in its own file, under `@types/`.
The exceptions to this rule are *next-env.d.ts* and *assets.d.ts* as NextJS required them to be located at the root of the repository.

=== Typing React components

We chose to type React component like so:

[source, typescript]
----
import React from "react";

// Without props.
const Foo: React.FC = () => {
  return <React.Fragment />;
};

// With props.
const Bar: React.FC<{ foo: "bar" }> = ({ foo }) => {
  return <div>{foo}</div>;
};
----

If you are not familiar with TypeScript generic types, please take a look at the https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html[documentation].

== Components

=== Next's links

Next's `Link` component requires its child to be an anchor tag. To lighten the JSX, we made a custom component called `NeutralLink` that provides the anchor tag.

=== Social Identities

When adding a new supported Social Identity to the application, remember to add the corresponding icon as SVG.

=== Dev buttons

To help with repetitive tasks during the development of a feature, or to help debugging, we have added a set dev buttons to trigger various action on press. You can find them inside `src/components/dev-buttons`.
To enable them, you will have to render `<DevButtons/>` inside `_app.tsx`, like this:

[source, typescript]
---- 
import { DevButtons } from "@src/components/dev-buttons/dev-buttons";

const AccountApp: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <SSRProvider>
      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <Head>
          <meta
            name="viewport"
            content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width"
          />
          <title>Connect Account</title>
        </Head>
        <GlobalStyle />
        <AlertMessages />
        <SWRConfig
          value={{
            // ...
          }}
        >
          {children}
        </SWRConfig>
        <DevButtons/>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </SSRProvider>
  );
};
----

We have also added a test to ensure that the component is not being rendered in review/production env, so don't forget to remove `<DevButtons/>` when you are done. If you need to add new buttons, feel free to do so.

== Style

=== Global style

The `global-style` CSS sheet, found in `/src/design-system/global-style.css`, is used to import built-in `tailwincss` rules and remove undesired style and behavior found in HTML. 

> Note that we chose to set the global font size to *62.5%*. This font size means that '1rem' is exactly equal to '10px', which makes setting REM values very simple.

=== SVG

If you want to use SVGs in your application, we recommend to render them as a React component, instead of importing the file:

[source, jsx]
----
import React from 'react'

const SVGIcon: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <svg>
      // ...
    </svg>
  )
};

export { SVGIcon };
----

When SVG are monochromatic (i.e. _icons_) and to improve components reusability, we replace the `fill` attribute value of tags composing SVG, such as `path`, with the CSS variable `currentColor` instead of hardcoded color codes. 
This way, the SVG will be rendered with the color inherited from its parent. 

[source, jsx]
----
import React from 'react';

const CrossIcon: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <svg>
      <path fill="currentColor">...</path>
      // ...
    </svg>
  )
};
----

When you use Figma to export SVG, be sure to export the upper component (i.e. *name 40x40*).

Also remember to add a `<title/>` JSX tag under the `<svg/>` tag for accessibility.

== Database

We are using DynamoDB as our persistence layer. Its K/V structure allows fast performances, but you'll need to be aware of some specificities, like being unable to update an existing value.

== Cookies

We store the `access_token` and `sub` in what we call a `UserCookie`. It is a sealed object living in the user's browser.
We also store alert messages in the user cookies, with no sealing.

== Accessibility

We want our application to be accessible. To do so, besides following good practices and standards, we chose to use https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html[@react-aria] external library to ease the accessibility implementation.

== i18n

We made the choice to use https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation/[react-intl], and to localize our strings to *English* and *French*.

=== Localized string object

Localized strings are located inside `en.ts` and `fr.ts`. The strings are organized following the router *path* they will called on. We then give the string an ID to be able to call them.

> Note that the ID naming is still WIP.

=== Client side

To localize client side generated strings, you can use the `useIntl` hook like this:

[source, jsx]
----
import React from "react";
import { useIntl } from "react-intl";

const LocalizedString: React.FC = () => {
  const { formatMessage } = useIntl();

  return (
    <p>{formatMessage({ id: "stringID" })}</p>
  )
};
----

This will call the key's value inside the router path's key. *If no value are found, the ID will be used as fallback*.

=== Server side

For server side generated strings, we generate an `intl` object, and pass the needed strings (see `intl.ts`).

[source, ts]
----
import { createIntl, createIntlCache } from "@formatjs/intl";

import * as locales from "@content/locales";

const cache = createIntlCache();
const enIntl = createIntl(
  {
    locale: "en",
    messages: { ...locales["en"].alertMessages },
  },
  cache,
);

export "enIntl"
----

== Testing

=== Unit testing

For unit testing, we are using https://jestjs.io/[Jest].

=== User interaction with components

We are using https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library[Testing Library] to test components behavior regarding user interactions.

=== User flow

We are using https://github.com/getgauge/taiko[Taiko] to test our workflows.

=== CI/CD pipeline

To automate our test processes, we use https://circleci.com[CircleCI], which allow us to run our test suites on new commit pushed to each pull request.

Several flows (or `jobs`) are executed in this context and orchestrated in workflows inside the `config.yml` file: 

- *lint-and-tests*: runs the code linting and the integration/unit tests.
- *e2e-tests*: runs the e2e test suite on a deployed Connect.Account version.
- *lighthouse*: runs the Lighthouse audits on a deployed Connect.Account version.
- *promote-to-production*: used to automate the production deployment from staging when the test suite is successful.


== Monitoring

We are using https://docs.sentry.io/[Sentry] to monitor production and review app's exceptions raised.

We're using https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/[Sentry Next.js SDK] and have added a wrapper around the `withSentry` middleware to be able to use is it with SSR.

== Documentation

=== Diagrams

We are using https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] to make the sequences diagram.

To compile your PlantUML code, you can run the following:

----
cat name-of-the-file.uml | docker run  --rm -i fewlines/developers-portal-diagram-generator plantuml -Djava.awt.headless=true -p -tjpg > name-of-the-file.jpg
----
