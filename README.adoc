= Connect Account
:toc: preamble

Connect Account is an open source app, which aims at providing all the business logic to handle Connect identities and profile data, and a default frontend for User to use it.

== Flows

=== Connect authentication flow

For more information, check the Authorization code flow https://developers.fewlines.co/guides/authorization_code_flow/overview/[documentation].

=== Identity commands and queries

== NPM scripts

=== Setup

Before being able to start the project locally, you should have a way to run `Node.js` applications.

We recommend you to install the latest version of `asdf` to do so.

You will need `nodejs` and `yarn`.
These can be installed via the provided `.tool-versions` using `asdf install`.

Get required environment variables by copying `.env.sample` and if necessary tuning it to values relevant to your dev environment:

[source, shell]
----
cp .env_vars.sample .env_vars
ln -s Procfile.dev Procfile
----

Source the file to get variables defined your environnement:

[source, shell]
----
source .env_vars
----

The application also needs couple external tools to work properly:
- hivemind
- docker
- docker-compose
- nginx
- mkcert

To install them on MacOS, you can run the following:
[source, shell]
----
brew bundle install --file Brewfile
----

== HTTPS certificates

To allow TLS locally, we are using a `nginx` proxy. The proxy listens port 29704, and redirects — with the certificates — on port 29703.

You might need the HTTPS certificates on your localhost to allow cookies writing.

If you are using Firefox as your web browser, you'll need `nss` alongside `mkcert`.
----
brew install nss
----

To generate certificates:
----
mkdir certs
(cd certs; mkcert connect-account.local)
----

Then, add the local FQDN in `/etc/hosts`:
----
echo "127.0.0.1 connect-account.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo "::1 connect-account.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
----

=== Development Process

[source, shell]
----
hivemind

# In an other terminal tab
docker-compose up
----

Access your application on URL: `https://connect-account.local:29704`.

If you want to build and start the application, you should run the following:

[source, shell]
----
yarn build && yarn start [-p 29703]
----

=== Testing

[source, shell]
----
yarn test
----

=== Storybook

If you wish to run the Storybook server, you can run the following: 

[source, shell]
----
yarn storybook
----

Note that it can take some time for Storybook to run, even when the compilation is done.
If you wish to build it, you can run the following:

[source, shell]
----
yarn build-storybook
----

=== Linting

We use a set of strict linting rules through `TypeScript` and `ESLint`. While `TypeScript` config is pretty standard, the `ESLint` one is mostly set with our own custom package, called https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fewlines/eslint-config[@fewlines/eslint-config]. You should read the documentation if you want the full power of the config while using `VSCode`.

> Note that, contrary to `errors`, `warnings` do not break testing or app compilation.

You can manually lint, using:

[source, shell]
----
yarn lint
----

or

[source, shell]
----
yarn lint --fix
----

if you want to automatically fix linting issues.

=== Pre-push trigger

We are using `Husky` to trigger the linting and building of the app before pushing the code to GitHub to prevent unnecessary `Heroku` builds. We do not plan to migrate from version `4.x` to `5.x`.

== TypeScript

=== Type declaration

The rule we follow is that, if a declared type is only used in one file, we locate it in said file. Otherwise, we move it in its own file, under `@types/`.
The exceptions to this rule are *next-env.d.ts* and *assets.d.ts* as NextJS required them to be located at the root of the repository.

=== Typing React components

We chose to type React component like so:

[source, typescript]
----
import React from "react";

// Without props.
export const Foo: React.FC = () => { return ;}

// With props.
type BarProps = { foo: "bar" }

export const Bar: React.FC<BarProps> = ({ foo }) => { return <div>{ foo }</div>}
----

If you are not familiar with TypeScript generic types, please take a look at the https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html[documentation].

== Components

=== Next's links

Next's `Link` component requires its child to be an anchor tag. To lighten the JSX, we made a custom component called `NeutralLink` that provides the anchor tag.

=== Social Identities

When adding a new supported Social Identity to the application, remember to add the corresponding icon as SVG.

== Style

=== Global style

The `globalStyle` object, found in `/src/design-system/globals/globalStyle.tsx`, is used to remove undesired style and behavior found in HTML. 

> Note that we chose to set the global font size to *62.5%*. This font size means that '1rem' is exactly equal to '10px', which makes setting REM values very simple.

The `globalStyle` is scoped in the `_app` page component.

=== Theme

You should prioritize theme values over arbitrary CSS values.

The theme structure is defined inside the `src/@types/styled-component.d.ts` definition type file.

The theme values are set inside `src/design-system/theme/lightTheme.ts` file. Each field are set individually, then assigned to the `lightTheme` variable.

The theme access is scoped in the `_app` page component.

You can access the theme properties and values inside a `styled` component by calling the `theme` props:

[source, typescript]
----
import styled from "styled-components";

// Note that styled component are PascalCase.
const StyledComponent = styled.div`
  css-property: ${({ theme }) => theme.themeKey};
`
----

You can access the theme properties and values from everywhere else with the custom `useTheme` hook:

[source, typescript]
----
import { useTheme } from "relative/path/to/the/design-system/theme/useTheme";

const theme = useTheme();
----

To access our breakpoint definitions, you can import the `breakpointDevices` object from the theme file and apply the wanted breakpoint with the `@media` keyword:

[source, typescript]
----
import { deviceBreakpoints } from "relative/path/to/the/theme";

const StyledComponent = styled.div {
  @media ${deviceBreakpoints.xs} {}

  @media ${deviceBreakpoints.s} {}

  @media ${deviceBreakpoints.m} {}

  @media ${deviceBreakpoints.l} {}
}
----

Our chosen viewport breakpoints are : `576px` | `768px` | `992px` | `1200px`.

Sometimes, you want to pass custom props to your styled component. Here is the way to do it:

[source, typescript]
----
type StyledButtonProps = { isActive: boolean };

const StyledComponent = styled.button<StyledButtonProps>`
  ${({ isActive, theme }) => `color: ${isActive ? theme.green : theme.grey}`};
`;
----

=== SVG

If you want to use SVGs in your application, we recommend to render them as a React component, instead of importing the file:

[source, jsx]
----
import React from 'react'

export const SvgIcon: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <svg>
      ...
    </svg>
  )
}
----

When you use Figma to export SVG, be sure to export the upper component (i.e. *name 40x40*).

Also remember to add a `<title/>` JSX tag under the `<svg/>` tag for accessibility.

== Database

We are using DynamoDB as our persistence layer. It's K/V structure allows fast performances, but you'll need to be aware of some specificities, like being unable to update an existing value.

== Session

TODO

== Storybook

We chose to document, and develope our components in isolation using https://storybook.js.org/[Storybook 6].

To create a story, all you have to do is create a file named as the component, add the `.stories` part and follow this template:

[source, jsx]
----
import React from "react";

import { Component } from "./Component";

export default { title: "Title you want to display, usually the name of the component", component: Component };

export const SubNameOfTheStory = (): JSX.Element => {
  return <Component />;
};
----

> Note that the story needs to be at the same level as the component.

== Testing

=== Unit testing

For unit testing, we are using https://jestjs.io/[Jest].

=== User interaction with components

We are using https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library[Testing Library] to test components behavior regarding user interactions.

=== User flow

We are using https://github.com/getgauge/taiko[Taiko] to test our workflows.

=== Github Actions

To automate our test processes, we use https://docs.github.com/en/actions[Github Actions] to execute workflows, which allow us to run our test suites on new commit pushed to each pull request.

Regarding our main flow for end to end tests (i.e `e2e-test.yml`), here is the gist of it. 
Since we had to trigger different flows based on a third party event (i.e. `review app deployment`), we couldn't leverage Github checks management automation on PR.
Once we receive the status of the deployment from our third party actor, we run our end to end test suite (`e2e-tests` job inside `e2e-test.yml`) if the review app deployment is a success, or we skip it in the case of a failure during the process.
In the last job (`create-e2e-status-check` inside `e2e-test.yml`), we create manually a https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks[status check].
If the deployment failed, we set its status to failure too. When the end to end test suite can be runned, we wait for it to complete before setting the custom `status check` state according to the tests results. 

All of these cases are handled at job-level, mostly thanks to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions[job status check functions], which permit to control more precisely jobs execution via conditional statements. 

Inside most of our jobs, we used TypeScript written scripts to perform our actions (i.e. _fetching Github API to handle check-run creation and update_).

== Monitoring

We are using https://docs.sentry.io/[Sentry] to monitor production and review app's exceptions raised.

A custom utility function, called `addRequestScopeToSentry`, is provided to format the data used for the report.

=== Diagrams

We are using https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] to make the sequences diagram.

To compile your PlantUML code, you can run the following:
